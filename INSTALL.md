# Installation

This software is a proof of concept. As such you need to have
Go version 1.13 or better to compile it and then to manually
install it.  You also need Python 3.7 or better. Typically the 
following steps are done to install (example is POSIX 
system based).

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor
    cd andor
    make
```
