# Welcome to [And/Or](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor) People Demo

This is a demo of And/Or a web base multi-user version of 
[dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset). It is a web
service designed to build curation tools for metadata that doesn't
currently fit in our existing repository and catalog systems.

The demo shows basic curation operations like listing keys,
and creating, reading, updating and deleting JSON documents 
in a collection based on the a Caltech Library's 
Identity project.

[people](/people/)
: demonstrates a simple person object collection. People objects consist of a 
series of unique ids (e.g. orcid, snac, wikidata, viaf) and name forms.
