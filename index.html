<h1>AndOr</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="red">An</span>other <span class="red">d</span>igital <span class="red">O</span>bject <span class="red">r</span>epository</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a concept document for a very light weight digital object
repository. If prototoyped successfully it could serve as an
interim repository for some of our simple EPrints deployments.</p>

<p><strong>AndOr</strong> would be built from <a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset">dataset</a> collections, simple  configuration files, a minimal JSON
semi-RESTful web API plus staticly hosted HTML and Javascript.
A running system would probably consist of only a few pieces of
software. The software stack could be as light as a web server
(e.g. NginX, Apache) providing integration options for authentication
(e.g. BasicAUTH, Shibboleth) plus the <strong>AndOr</strong> web service
written in Go. If the collection was larger we could create
a search interface via Python and Lunr, otherwise search could be
implemented browser side with Lunr.  This arrange has the advantage
of limitting the code that has to be written to the web service
plus some HTML pages and a bit of JavaScript.  This particular
architecture that is much more aligned with cloud hosting and
keeping hosting cost to a minimum a small EC2 instance and an S3 bucket
is probably all you need.  With some planning you could probably get
costs down further by replacing the web server with Cloud Front,
moving all storage to S3 and using Amazon&rsquo;s Lambda or container
service to host <strong>AndOr</strong> web service.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide an <strong>interum option</strong> for EPrints repositories</li>
<li>Thin stack (e.g. No RDMS requirement, only AndOr and a web server)

<ul>
<li>Be simpler than EPrints, Invenio, Drupal/Islandora</li>
<li>Be easier than migrating our EPrints repositories to the cloud</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use existing schema</li>
<li>Support versioned attached media files</li>
<li>Support diffs for JSON metadata changes</li>
<li>Support continuous migration</li>
<li>Support multiple front ends (e.g. static HTML or Drupal)</li>
<li>Be extremely easy to migrate out of it (e.g. to a future Zenodo or Archipelego)</li>
<li>Be faster than EPrints especially EPrints when under a load</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset">dataset</a> collections are sufficient to hold metadata and media</li>
<li>small number of curratorial users</li>
<li>larger number of readers or potential depositors</li>
<li>configurable workflows are a requirement</li>
<li>workflows describe capabilities (permissions)</li>
<li>workflows describe a work queue (object state)</li>
<li>use existing object scheme (e.g. EPrints Oral Histories)</li>
<li>authentication is external (e.g. OAuth or Basic Author using the front end web server)</li>
<li>search and query are handle independently (e.g. Lunr either browser or server side)</li>
<li>UI can be implemented using HTML 5 elements and minimal JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitting features and complexity</h2>

<p>One of the most complicated parts of a digital object repository
is managing customization,  managing users, workflows, permissions
and enforcing storage scheme.  To simplify this <strong>AndOr</strong> is
using a workflow/work queue oriented permission scheme. The permission
scheme is configured/managed outside the web UI of <strong>AndOr</strong>. It&rsquo;s
just a mater of creating some JSON objects and storing them in a
dataset collection that <strong>AndOr</strong> reads.  Users are define/managed
outside the web UI of <strong>AndOr</strong>.  Password management is deferred
to the authenticating service.  Managing users, workflows and
permissions reduces the end points needed in the API and radically
reduces the lines of code needed to produce a modern web UI.</p>

<p>Two API end points would be required <code>/COLLECTION_NAME/objects/OBJECT_ID</code>
to provide an Object&rsquo;s details and <code>/COLLECTION_NAME/objects/</code>. The
later may accept a filter by queue/workflow name. All other end
points are static resources (e.g. index.html, CSS, lunr indexes).
Recuding service to two end points reflects our experience with
the EPrints REST API.  The API end points only need to support GET
and POST operations and can be restricted to expecting JSON
object responses which should simplify writing the update code
for data coming from the browser.</p>

<p>Initially the UI will consist of listing records, viewing record
details, list of records by work queue (workflow state),
a page to create/read/edit individual objects and a login page.
Once that is working we can generate Lunr indexes and additionally
provide that as a means of record discover and retrieval.</p>

<p>Authenticated users return their authenticated user id, e.g.
(e.g.  ORCID if authenticating via orcid.org). The user id
will be used to map users to their workflows.</p>

<p>Unauthenticated users are treated as the &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; user and
are restricted by workflows available for that user. This is how
you would control having a dark versus publically visible repository.</p>

<p>A user&rsquo;s membership in workflows/queue defines their permissions.</p>

<p><strong>AndOr</strong> is built on dataset so all objects must have unique ids.
Objects may include attached documents which will be versioned
automatically (a feature available in an upcoming release of
dataset).  We can also store diffs of the JSON documents for
metadata versioning.</p>

<p><strong>AndOr</strong> does not directly support deleting objects. You can
create this ability through creating a &ldquo;delete&rdquo; workflow type.
Objects flagged as deleted in the API will would be changed to
the queue status of &ldquo;deleted&rdquo;. A separate offline process could
be developed for garbage collecting those records at a future
date (this is how EPrints works).</p>
