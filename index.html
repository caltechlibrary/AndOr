</blockquote>

<p>This is a concept document for a very light weight digital object
repository implemented as &quot;a multi-user version of
<a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset">dataset</a> with a web
based GUI&quot;. It targets the ability to curate
metadata objects and attachments outside the scope of
our existing repositories.</p>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong> is based on <a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset">dataset</a>.
It is a web JSON API plus HTML, CSS and JavaScript providing a web
GUI interface for curating objects.  A minimum running system
would consist of two pieces of software.  The minimum is
a web server<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> plus the <strong>And/Or</strong> service supporting
multi-user interaction with dataset collections.  Additional
functionality would be provided by other systems or services<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong> is a extremely narrowly scoped web service. The focus
is <strong>ONLY</strong> on currating objects and related attachments.</p>

<p>Limiting <strong>And/Or</strong>'s scope leads to a simpler system. Code
is limited to <strong>And/Or</strong> web service plus the HTML,
CSS and JavaScript needed for an acceptable UI<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This architecture aligns with small machine hosting
and cloud hosting. Both keeping recurring costs to a minimum.
<strong>And/Or</strong> could be run on a tiny to small EC2 instance or
on hardware as small as a Rasbpberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide a curatorial platform for metadata outside our existing repositories</li>
<li>Provide an <strong>interim curation option</strong> for EPrints repositories requiring migration</li>
<li>Thin stack

<ul>
<li>No RDMS requirement (only And/Or and a web server)</li>
<li>Be easier to implement than migrating an EPrints repository</li>
<li>Be faster than EPrints under for curating objects</li>
<li>Be simpler than EPrints, Invenio and Drupal/Islandora</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use existing schema</li>
<li>Support role based workflows</li>
<li>Support versioned attached media files</li>
<li>Support continuous migration</li>
<li>Support alternative front ends (e.g. Drupal)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-assumptions">Project Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset">dataset</a> collections are sufficient to hold metadata and media</li>
<li>UI can be implemented using HTML 5 elements, minimal JavaScript and CSS</li>
<li>Small number of curatorial <a href="docs/User-Scheme.html">users</a></li>
<li>Configurable <a href="docs/Roles-Scheme.html">roles</a> are a requirement

<ul>
<li>roles describes permissions for objects in given states</li>
<li>roles describes states an object can be asigned to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use existing object scheme (e.g. EPrints XML in Oral Histories)</li>
<li>Authentication is external (e.g. Basic Auth, JWT, Shibboleth, OAuth 2)</li>
<li>Other systems handle any additoinal requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="limiting-features-and-complexity">Limiting features and complexity</h2>

<p>Some of the most complicated parts of digital object repositories
are managing customization, managing users, manage roles,
manage permissions, enforcing storage scheme and presenting
public can private views of respository content.  <strong>And/Or</strong>'s
simplification involves avoiding functionality provided
by other systems and relocating requirements to an appropriate
external system while only focusing on the narrow problem
of curating objects.</p>

<p>Examples--</p>

<ul>
<li>Authentication is handle externally. That means we don't need to create web UI to manage passwords and user profiles. Volatile and sensitive data is outside of <strong>And/Or</strong> so it can't be stolen from <strong>And/Or</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>And/Or</strong> itself is a simple web API that accepts URL requests
and hands back JSON. It supports a small number of URL end points that support specific actions with one HTTP method (e.g. GET or POST) per end point.</li>
<li>Object sheme is determined at time of migrating into  the dataset collection. <strong>And/Or</strong> provides no customization.  If you want to change your data shapes you write a script to do that and you change your HTML form.</li>
<li>If you need additional end points beyond what <strong>And/Or</strong> provides (e.g. a search engine service, a electronic thesis workflow) you create those as micro services either behind the same webserver or else where.</li>
</ul>

<p>The web browser creates the illusion of a unified software system
or single process. A single application is not required to support all
desire functionality (e.g. curration and public web consumption) because
<strong>And/Or</strong> uses a composible model available to all web applications.
Customization is deferred to other micro services and external
systems (e.g. looking up a record on datacite.org or orcid.org)</p>

<p>Some features are unavoidable in curation tool. Repositories run
on the assumption of users and roles. Interestingly it
doesn't require users and roles be manage through the web.
Setting up users and roles can be managed through simple to implement
command line tools and configuration files.  This is reasonable in
large part because <strong>And/Or</strong> off loads identify management
and can be restarted quickly (i.e. configuration files are easily
parsed).</p>

<p>By focusing on a minimal feature set and leveraging technical
opportunities that already exist we can radically
reduce the lines of code written and maintained.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong>'s engine is <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset">dataset</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>End points map directly to existing dataset operations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>dataset operations supported in <strong>And/Or</strong> are &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;create&quot;,
&quot;read&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;attach&quot;, &quot;attachments&quot;, &quot;detach&quot;
and &quot;prune&quot;. These map to URL paths each supporting a single
HTTP Method.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/keys/</code> (GET) all object keys</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/create/OBJECT_ID</code> (GET) to creates an Object, an OBJECT_ID must be unique to succeed</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/read/OBJECT_IDS</code> (GET) returns on or more objects, if more than one is requested then an array of objects is returned.</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/update/OBJECT_ID</code> (POST) to update an object</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/delete/OBJECT_ID</code> (POST) to delete an object</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/attach/OBJECT_ID/SEMVER</code> (POST) attach a document to object</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/attachments/OBJECT_ID</code> (GET) list attachments to object</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/detach/OBJECT_ID/SEMVER/ATTACHMENT_NAME</code> (GET) get an attachments to object</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/prune/OBJECT_ID/SEMVER/ATTACHMENT_NAME</code> (POST) remove an attachment version</li>
</ul>

<p>One additional end point is needed beyond dataset. We need to assign
object states to enable workflows.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/assign/OBJECT_ID/NEW_STATE</code> (POST) to assign an object to a new state</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong> is a thin layer on top of existing dataset functionality.
E.g. dataset supplies attachment versioning, <strong>And/Or</strong> exposes that
in the attachment related end points. If dataset gained the ability
to version JSON documents (e.g. stored diffs of JSON documents<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>),
that functionality could be included in <strong>And/Or</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="web-ui">Web UI</h3>

<p>Five pages would need to be designed and implemented in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript for our proof of concept.</p>

<ol>
<li>Login and landing page</li>
<li>Display List records (filterable by object state)</li>
<li>Display Object details</li>
<li>Create/edit Object details</li>
<li>Page to display user roles</li>
</ol>

<p>For public facing content (e.g. things Google, Bing, et el.
should find and index) can be deployed separately by
process similar to how feeds.library.caltech.edu works.
This also keeps <strong>And/Or</strong> simple with fewer requirements.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-composibility">Examples of composibility</h3>

<p>When listing a collection objects suggests the need for paging.
&quot;keys&quot; can be used client side to create a segmented key list and when
combined with &quot;read&quot; which can accept more than one id we now have
a means of paging through a collection's objects.</p>

<p>A collection could be publically viewable (e.g. Oral Histories)
by writing a script that reads the dataset collection <strong>And/Or</strong> is
referencing rendering web pages appropriately (e.g. like we do
with feeds).</p>

<p>A search interface can be created by indexing the dataset collection
and presenting a search UI. (E.g. Like Stephen's demo of Lunr
providing a search Caltech People pages).</p>

<p>A deposit system could be created as a microservice in Drupal
to accept metadata and documents before handing them of to
<strong>And/Or</strong> via a service account.</p>

<h3 id="user-role-object-state-is-a-simple-model">User/role/object state is a simple model</h3>

<p>An authenticated user exposes their user id to
<strong>And/Or</strong>'s web service. The web service can then
retrieve the available roles that scope the permissions
the user has to operate on objects in a given set of states.
The role can also be used to define which objects we show
the user.  This can be implemented with a small number
of functions such as <code>getUsername()</code>, <code>getUserRoles()</code>,
<code>isAllowed()</code> and <code>canAssign()</code>.</p>

<p>Once authorization is calculated then approvided actions
can be handle with simple HTTP handlers that perform a simple
task mapping to an existing dataset function (e.g. keys,
create, read, update).</p>

<h3 id="the-special-case-of-deleting-objects">The special case of deleting objects</h3>

<p>Like EPrints <strong>And/Or</strong> should not directly support deleting objects.
Instead the concept of deletion in <strong>And/Or</strong> is to assign the object's
<code>._State</code> value to &quot;deleted&quot;. This makes deletion work like a Mac's
trashcan and fully deleting objects would be accomplished by
a separte process performing emptying the trash<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>
