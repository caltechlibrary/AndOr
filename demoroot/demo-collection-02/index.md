# Welcome to And/Or Demo

In this demo we focusing on listing objects in the various
object states. For the purposes of discussions objects which
share a common state are said to be in a "queue". This is
analogous to EPrints where objects in a common state are said
to be in a "buffer". A queue is like a mailbox. It simply lists
the objects in key order with the common state.

The queues listed will vary with the roles and the individual
who is currently logged in. Ideally you should only see the queues
that your roles support. For thie demo we just define all the
possible states and if you don't have permissions then you'll
be prompted to login with a different set of credentials.
