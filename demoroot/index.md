# Welcome to [And/Or](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor)

This is a demo of And/Or[^1], a JSON object web service based on
[dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset) collections. 
E.g. a demo dataset collection, "demo-colloction-01.ds". 

The Web UI are built from static HTML/CSS/JavaScripts making http 
calls to the web service.  Web UI is located under the collection,
e.g. `/demo-collection-01/`. The JavaScript library, `/demo.js`, provides
examples of how to call the JSON API and render results in a webpage.
