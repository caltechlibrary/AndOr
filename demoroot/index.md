# Welcome to [And/Or](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor) Demo

This is a demo of And/Or[^1], a web base multi-user version of 
[dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset). It is a web
service designed to build curation tools for metadata that doesn't
currently fit in our existing repository and catalog systems.

The demo shows basic curation operations like listing keys,
records and managing JSON documents in a collection
a Caltech People inspired project.

+ [demo-people.ds](/demo-people/) demonstrates a simple person object collection. People objects consist of a series of unique ids (e.g. orcid, snac, wikidata, viaf) and name forms.
