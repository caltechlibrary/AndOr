impact listing objects. The users ester, jane, innez,
bea, and millie have different roles and as a result will
see different object lists.

+ [List All Objects](list.html) - list all objects
+ [List Objects](list.html?keys=100,101,102,103) - list objects (paged)
+ [List "published" Objects](list.html?state=published)
+ [View Object](view.html?key=100) - view object with key "100"

JSON objects:
