<p><span class="red">An</span>other <span class="red">d</span>igital / <span class="red">O</span>bject <span class="red">r</span>epository</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a concept document for a very light weight digital object
repository implemented as &quot;a multi-user version of
<a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset">dataset</a> with a web
based GUI&quot;. It targets the ability to curate metadata objects
outside the scope of our existing repository systems.</p>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong> is based on <a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset">dataset</a>.
It is a web JSON API plus static HTML, CSS and JavaScript
providing a web GUI interface for curating objects.  It
is intended to function as a microservice running behind
a standard web server like Apache or NginX and
assessible via a reverse proxy configuration.
For the purposes of a proof of concept the minimum is
system is <strong>And/Or</strong> web server<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> providing static
web hosting, BasicAUTH authentication and supporting
multi-user interaction with dataset collections.<br>
Part of the design concept is that additional functionality
would be provided by other microservices or systems<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong> is a extremely narrowly scoped web service. The focus
is <strong>ONLY</strong> on currating JSON objects.</p>

<p>Limiting <strong>And/Or</strong>'s scope leads to a simpler system. Code
is limited to <strong>And/Or</strong> web service plus the HTML,
CSS and JavaScript needed for an acceptable UI<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This architecture aligns with small machine hosting
and cloud hosting. Both keeping recurring costs to a minimum.
<strong>And/Or</strong> could be run on a tiny to small EC2 instance or
on hardware as small as a Rasbpberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide a curatorial platform for metadata outside our existing repositories</li>
<li>Thin stack

<ul>
<li>No RDMS requirement (only And/Or and a web server)</li>
<li>Be easier to implement than migrating a repository</li>
<li>Be faster than EPrints for curating objects</li>
<li>Be simpler than EPrints, Invenio and Drupal/Islandora</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use existing schema</li>
<li>Support role based workflows</li>
<li>Support continuous migration</li>
<li>Support alternative front ends (e.g. Drupal in front of And/Or)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-assumptions">Project Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset">dataset</a> collections are sufficient to hold metadata</li>
<li>UI can be implemented using HTML 5 elements, minimal JavaScript and CSS</li>
<li>Small number of curatorial <a href="docs/User-Scheme.html">users</a></li>
<li>Configurable <a href="docs/Roles-Scheme.html">roles</a> are a requirement

<ul>
<li>roles describes permissions for objects in given states</li>
<li>roles describes states an object can be asigned to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use existing object scheme (e.g. EPrints XML in Oral Histories)</li>
<li>Authentication is external (e.g. Basic Auth, JWT, Shibboleth, OAuth 2)</li>
<li>Other systems handle any additoinal service requirements (e.g. search, storage of uploaded objects)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="limiting-features-and-complexity">Limiting features and complexity</h2>

<p>Some of the most complicated parts of digital object repositories
are managing customization, managing users, manage roles,
manage permissions, enforcing storage scheme and presenting
public can private views of respository content.  <strong>And/Or</strong>'s
simplification involves avoiding functionality provided
by other systems and relocating requirements to an appropriate
external system while only focusing on the narrow problem
of curating objects.</p>

<p>Examples--</p>

<ul>
<li>Authentication is handle externally. That means we don't need to create web UI to manage passwords and user profiles. Volatile and sensitive data is outside of <strong>And/Or</strong> so it can't be stolen from <strong>And/Or</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>And/Or</strong> itself is a simple web API that accepts URL requests
and hands back JSON. It supports a small number of URL end points that support specific actions with one HTTP method (e.g. GET or POST) per end point.</li>
<li>Object sheme is determined at time of migrating into the dataset collection. <strong>And/Or</strong> itself provides no mechanism customization beyond the input forms retrieving and submitting objects.  If you want to change your data shapes you write a script to do that and you change your HTML form.</li>
<li>If you need additional end points beyond what <strong>And/Or</strong> provides (e.g. a search engine service, a electronic thesis workflow) you create those as micro services either behind the same webserver or else where.</li>
</ul>

<p>A web browser can create the illusion of a unified software system
or single process. A single application is not required to support all
desire functionality (e.g. curration and public web consumption) because
<strong>And/Or</strong> uses a composible model available to all web applications.
Customization is limited to static HTML, CSS and JavaScript or deferred
to other micro services and external systems (e.g. looking up a record
on datacite.org or orcid.org)</p>

<p>Some features are unavoidable in curation tool. Repositories run
on the assumption of users and roles. Interestingly it
doesn't require users and roles be manage through the web.
Setting up users and roles can be managed through simple to implement
command line tools and configuration files.  This is reasonable in
large part because <strong>And/Or</strong> off loads identify management
and can be restarted quickly (i.e. configuration files are easily
parsed and reloaded).</p>

<p>By focusing on a minimal feature set and leveraging technical
opportunities that already exist we can radically
reduce the lines of code written and maintained.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong>'s JSON document storage engine is <a href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset">dataset</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>End points map directly to existing dataset operations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>dataset operations supported in <strong>And/Or</strong> are &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;create&quot;,
&quot;read&quot;, &quot;update&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;.  These map to URL paths each supporting
a single HTTP Method (either GET or POST).</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/keys/</code> (GET) all object keys</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/create/OBJECT_ID</code> (GET) to creates an Object, an OBJECT_ID must be unique to succeed</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/read/OBJECT_IDS</code> (GET) returns on or more objects, if more than one is requested then an array of objects is returned.</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/update/OBJECT_ID</code> (POST) to update an object</li>
<li><code>/COLLECTION_NAME/delete/OBJECT_ID</code> (POST) to delete an object</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong> is a thin layer on top of existing dataset functionality.
E.g. dataset supplies attachment versioning <strong>And/Or</strong> does not.
That functionality but could easily be added. The idea is that as
dataset matures and gains the abilities useful in a multi-user
context <strong>And/Or</strong> would be enhanced to support the additional
dataset features by mapping them to an appropriate URL end point.
Example, if adding versioning to JSON documents (e.g.
stored diffs of JSON documents<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>) as added to dataset,
that functionality was available in dataset it could be included
in <strong>And/Or</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="web-ui">Web UI</h3>

<p>Four pages static web pages need to be designed per collection and
implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for our proof of concept.</p>

<ol>
<li>Login and landing page</li>
<li>Display List records (filterable by object state)</li>
<li>An edit page that supports CRUD operations</li>
<li>Page to display the logged in user roles</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="limited-functionality-is-intentional">Limited functionality is intentional</h3>

<p><strong>And/Or</strong> is NOT for public facing content system
(e.g. things Google, Bing, et el.  should find and index)
Machanisms for public facing content should be deployed
separately by processes similar to how feeds.library.caltech.edu
works. This keeps <strong>And/Or</strong> simple with fewer requirements.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-composibility">Examples of composibility</h3>

<p>When listing a large collection objects prudence
suggests the need for paging. After retrieving all keys we can
implement paging by using the &quot;read&quot; method with a list of keys
we want to view.  This allows us to segment a large collection
into manageable chunks.</p>

<p>A search interface could be created as a microserve in the manner
of Stevens' Lunr demo for Caltech People. If <strong>And/Or</strong> and the
search microserver are behind the same web server you could present
both services using a common URL namespace (Apache or NingX are
good candites from a front facing web server integrating <strong>And/Or</strong>
and your search system).</p>

<h3 id="user-role-object-state-is-a-simple-model">User/role/object state is a simple model</h3>

<p>An authenticated user exposes their user id to
<strong>And/Or</strong>'s web service. The web service can then
retrieve the available roles that scope the permissions
the user has to operate on objects in a given set of states.
The role can also be used to define which objects we show
the user.  This can be implemented with a small number
of functions such as <code>getUsername()</code>, <code>getUserRoles()</code>,
<code>isAllowed()</code> and <code>canAssign()</code>.</p>

<p>Once authorization is calculated then approvided actions
can be handle with simple HTTP handlers that perform a simple
task mapping to an existing dataset function (e.g. keys,
create, read, update, delete).</p>

<h3 id="a-special-case-of-deleting-objects">A special case of deleting objects</h3>

<p>While <strong>And/Or</strong> service can delete objects it's more
prudent to take the EPrints approach and define &quot;delete&quot;
as a specific object state. This way you could treat
deleted objects as being in a trashcan and leave actual
deletion for a garbage collection routine.  This  approach would
make deletion work like a Mac's trashcan and fully deleting
objects would be accomplished by a separte process performing
emptying the trash<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>
