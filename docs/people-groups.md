# People and Groups

This use case seeks to provide an alterate curating interface
for data we currently maintain in a collection of Google Sheets.
This is strictly a metadata repository so it a simple example
playing to basic **dataset** functionality. The models are
currently column and row based so the objects stored are
very simple.

## Goal 

+ Harvest existing spreadsheets for Group and People
+ Demonstrate creating and editing people can group objects
+ Provide a means of getting reports in CSV or TAB output
