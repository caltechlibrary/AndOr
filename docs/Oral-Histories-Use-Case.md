# Oral Histories as use case

FIXME: Write up notes on migration, cover using existing tools for harvest (e.g. ep). Discuss current features in EPrints, which features we can easily
implement and which will be dropped. Also cover separating 
curration from the public website (even if hosted at the same URL). 
Cover how the public facing version of Oral Histories could be rendered
just as we current render feeds.
