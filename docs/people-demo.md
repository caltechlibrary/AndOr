# People Demo

This use case seeks to provide an alterate curating interface
for data we currently maintain in a collection of Google Sheets.
This is strictly a metadata repository so it a simple example
playing to basic **dataset** functionality. The models are
currently column and row based so the objects stored are
simple key and value pairs. A more complex document could
be stored such as adding additional name formats or other
multi-value data.

## Goal 

+ Authenticating and viewing assigned roles and privileges
+ Demonstrate listing people objects
+ Demonstrate creating, reading, updating and deleting people objects
