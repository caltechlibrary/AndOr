# What is TOML?

"TOML" is a way of describing configuration. It is similar to and
inspired by Microsoft's ".ini" files. TOML can be easily translated
into JSON objects which makes it a good choice for processing
by programs.  On the otherhand TOML can be easier for humans to
type and read than JSON. It supports comments in the TOML files
which can aid us humans when we need to review how we've setup
things in the past.
